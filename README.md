## Details

Using netpkg-tool will restore and compile your project based on settings in your `*.csproj` file. By default, netpkg-tool will use [Framework Dependent Deployment](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/deploying/#framework-dependent-deployments-fdd) to compile your project. To use [Self-Contained Deployment](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd), use the `--scd` flag. The full process for netpkg-tool:

1. Restore project dependencies
2. Compile .NET Core app
3. Create AppDir and transfer files
4. Run appimagetool on created AppDir
5. Delete temporary files

## Mono

While this project is mainly aimed at Microsoft's new [.NET Core](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core/) ecosystem, it should be possible to eventually make this tool work with [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com/). Mono support is planned but no exact ETA can be given until the core utility is in a more stable state.

## Disclaimer

The netpkg-tool project is still in alpha development. Names, commands, and features are subject to change. Please keep this in mind when using this utility.
